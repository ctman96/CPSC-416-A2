Our program was tested against two other groups (referred to as group 1 and group 2). We tested in 
several configurations: in a group of 5 with two nodes from two groups, and one node from our group; 
and with a single node from either group, tested with both group 1 and group 2. We also at another 
point tested with less or more nodes from one or more of the groups.

For our tests with all groups together, we noticed that there was communication between our nodes 
and group 1, but no communication between group 2 nodes apart from between themselves. There was also 
some issues arising from group 1's nodes sending multiple coords to nodes that were higher in port number. 
After some debugging, we narrowed down the lack of communication from group 2 nodes as a result of a
lack of host-to-network (and vice versa) byte translation on the part of group 1 and us, which resulted
in us being able to communicate with group 2. We also made sure to use the same parameters when running nodes.

For our tests against group 1, no problems were found with how our nodes interacted with theirs.

Afterwards, we then fixed the problems by adding host to network byte order conversion for our packet send
function, and network to host byte order conversions for the packet receive function. This applied to all
data in the packet structure, including the message ID, election ID, and vector clock elements.
